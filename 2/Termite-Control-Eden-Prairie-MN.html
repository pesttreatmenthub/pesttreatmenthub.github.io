To resolve invasive pest problems, classical biological control approach is typically used where natural enemies from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control technique that has actually been effectively used versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
