<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the environment as a whole and takes into consideration a balanced mix of the aforementioned control techniques to produce the most efficient and least destructive plan.</p>

Insecticides poisonous to the majority of insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural enemies than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for particular insect species or life phases.</p>
