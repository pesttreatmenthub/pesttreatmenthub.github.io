<p>To get more corn per acre, having a strong understanding of the level of pressure and kind of pests is key for picking the very best corn characteristics and agronomic practices to attend to these challenges. Even with all the knowledge about the pest and availability of resources for its reliable management, losses can be prevented just when corrective actions are taken at the correct time.</p>
<p>Stay vigilant and contact your pest control professional for a follow-up treatment if you ever see pests returning after treatment. Modern crop ranges often accidentally produce conditions which prefer pest types (e.g., pest types which have bored deeper into larger fruit making them inaccessible to natural enemies). Anticipate SARS-CoV-2 to behave like an intrusive species introduced to a brand-new location when resources abound (that is, individuals without immunity) and there are no biological controls to keep the population in check or registered products to use in management (such as federally authorized medications).</p>
