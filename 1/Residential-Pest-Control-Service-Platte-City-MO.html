The foundation of a reliable IPM program is a schedule of routine assessments. Crop losses due to illness, arthropods, and weeds, though disputed by some as a valid procedure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the climax of pest control.</p>
<p>Improvements in pest management are required, and pesticides will likely constantly belong of the option.
