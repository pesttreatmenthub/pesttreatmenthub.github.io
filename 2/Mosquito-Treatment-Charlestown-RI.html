<p>Using healing tools, whether biological, chemical, or physical, as the main means of controlling pests rather than as occasional supplements to natural regulators to bring them into acceptable bounds breaks basic unifying principles and can not be sustainable. That is why, you should have the security that, if something takes place in the middle of the night, there will be a company that is there for you, it does not matter the hour or the pest, they will not over-charge you for getting to your house late at night.</p>
<p>Termites are such harmful pests that you desire your termite treatment to result in termite extermination. As soon as action, tracking, and identification limits indicate that pest control is required, and preventive approaches are no longer reliable or offered, IPM programs then examine the proper control approach both for efficiency and risk. The letter of invite for this plenary address recommended for its title the main theme of the whole Congress, i.e., the affirmative sentence: "Integrated Pest Management: A Worldwide Truth".</p>
