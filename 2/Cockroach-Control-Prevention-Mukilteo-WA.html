<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been suggested as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not take off due to the fact that growers were not ready for such an intercropping arrangement. If your facility presently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be surprised to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to approach least-impact product or services.</p>
<p>Current studies record the need for continued decreases in hazardous pesticide usage and practices. Although the standard components of IPM are always the very same, the specific elements of an IPM program differ from one environment or scenario to another. When done prior to spacing the plants, application of predatory termites versus thrips in potted plants is more effective.</p>
