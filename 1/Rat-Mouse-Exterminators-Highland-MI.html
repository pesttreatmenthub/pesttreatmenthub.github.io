Referred to as wood-eating insects, termites are one of the worst pests to come across.</p>
<p>Nobody likes pests and bugs whether they are rats, mosquitoes, lizards or cockroaches, flies and bees. One of the most typical indoor pests, an ant problem can be a challenging job to get rid of. Ants live in the smallest of the cracks and are typically discovered inside the walls, cabinets, corners of the wall, etc Smart resistance management will be a key for sustainable use of GM crops in IPM while there is a need for much better harmonization of GM crops with existing IPM methods.</p>
