<p>This physical control puts an instant end to pests' plant-damaging days. Pesticides not included in traps or baits must normally just be used to targeted areas, not sprayed over the whole space. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a philosophy that includes the management of a pest rather of eliminating a pest or controlling.
