<p>Part of this success originated from field schools which permitted local farmers to harness their indigenous understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the selection and use of pest control actions that will ensure favourable economic condition, environmental and social consequences 13 and applies to the majority of agricultural, public health and feature pest management scenarios.</p>
<p>Tracking and identification decreases the dangers of using the incorrect type of pesticide, or utilizing pesticides when other techniques will be more efficient. The advantage of the fogging pest control approach is that it's thought about to be eco-friendly, it's odor free and does not leave any residues that are difficult to be cleaned. Cultural practices - rely on a method to make the crop or environment inappropriate to pests by interfering with their oviposition preferences, host plant discrimination or location by both adults and immatures.</p>
