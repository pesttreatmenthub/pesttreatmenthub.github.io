<p>There are numerous farming practices that make the environment less favorable to insect pests. IPM extended the concept of integrated control to all classes of pests and was broadened to consist of all methods. This chapter discusses various techniques to keep pest insects at tolerable levels or in other words incorporated pest management (IPM).
