<p>The four major issues come across with standard pesticides are poisonous residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest revival (Lewis, 1997 ). The use of natural pesticides and organophosphates that are more environmentally friendly are encouraged and synthetic pesticides need to just be used as a last resort or only utilized as required and frequently only at particular times in a pests life cycle.</p>
<p>Improvements in pest management are needed, and pesticides will likely constantly be a part of the service.
