Crop losses due to arthropods, weeds, and diseases, though disputed by some as a valid measure, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) regardless of the climax of pest control.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural opponents and prevent pest determination consist of intercropping (several crops in the same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests far from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>These service technicians offer services to businesses, houses, and any other structures where unwanted pests might be located. . So, the pest control companies choose which approach works best in your case and after that they accordingly carry out the treatment.
