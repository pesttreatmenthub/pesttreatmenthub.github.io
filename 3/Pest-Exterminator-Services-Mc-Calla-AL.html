<p>Fifty seven of 66 broad spectrum pesticides used on rice at the time were banned by governmental decree (Morse & Buhler 1997). In addition to the research and outreach structure and the four components of management, elements that influence rewarding, safe, and budget-friendly food production at a larger scale and their implications for international food security should likewise be included in an IPM model.</p>
