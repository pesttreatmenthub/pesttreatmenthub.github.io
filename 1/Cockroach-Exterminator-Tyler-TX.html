<p>Stay watchful and call your pest control expert for a follow-up treatment if you ever see pests returning after treatment. Modern crop ranges often unintentionally develop conditions which prefer pest types (e.g., pest types which have bored deeper into larger fruit making them unattainable to natural enemies). Expect SARS-CoV-2 to behave like an intrusive types introduced to a new location when resources are plentiful (that is, individuals without immunity) and there are no biological controls to keep the population in check or registered products to use in management (such as federally authorized medications).</p>
