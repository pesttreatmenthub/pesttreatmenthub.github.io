These 20 rodenticide items usually trigger unreasonable adverse impacts on the environment, especially given that new rodent control items that satisfy the Company's safety requirements are now widely readily available, economical and reliable, and position considerably less risk to individuals and the environment.</p>
<p>These unidentified or poorly comprehended potential dangers argue for additional levels of defense consisting of exposures to several pesticides, in your home, at school and in the diet plan; exposure to chemicals in combination with pesticides such as pharmaceuticals, commercial compounds and personal care items; and the general problem in attributing chronic diseases to any one specific cause.</p>
