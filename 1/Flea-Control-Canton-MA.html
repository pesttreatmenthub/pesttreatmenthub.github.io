<p>Although multiple sources define IPM in various methods, previous models mainly concentrated on the ecological, and to some degree on the evolutionary, elements of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A recent IPM pyramid provided by Stenberg (2017) identified a lack of a holistic IPM approach that utilizes both modern-day and conventional tools.</p>
<p>Subsidies on pesticides were reduced from 75% in 1986 to 40% in 1987 and eliminated completely by January 1989 (APO 1993). Biological control - indicates a normal way of destroying pests as it happens in nature. Early detection of arthropod pests helps prevent the requirement to deal with comprehensive populations that may cause crop damage. Safety problems and environmental interruptions continue to occur (Wright, 1996 ), and there are renewed appeals for efficient, safe, and economically appropriate alternatives (Benbrook, 1996 ). Synthetic chemical pesticides are the most widely utilized approach of pest control.</p>
