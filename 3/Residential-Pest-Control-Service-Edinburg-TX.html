Most people typically consider pest control throughout the warmer months, when swarms of insects try to attack their backyards and homes, however, pests know no season.

<p>A technique that includes making use of pest-tolerant and pest-resistant cultivars established through conventional breeding or genetic modification (Douglas 2018, Kennedy 2008, Nelson et al. 2018 ). These cultivars possess physical, morphological, or biochemical characters that reduce the plant's appearance or viability for the pest to feed, develop, or reproduce successfully.</p>
<p>Screens, drifting row covers, or food containers with tight-fitting covers which act as barriers to pests. Pest control is the regulation and management of any species which comes under the definition of pests. One risk of utilizing pesticides is that pests might develop resistance, which indicates the pesticide is no longer effective.
