TAP insulation for attics, moisture barriers for crawl areas, and specifically crafted weather stripping for garage and entry doors not just discourage rodents and other devastating pests from entering and living in your house, they're energy efficient, too.</p>
<p>With a lot of products moving in and out of warehouse, and some sitting in storage for extended periods of time, it can be easy to overlook indications of pest activity in order to maintain a specific level of efficiency.
