<p>IPCA strongly advises employing skilled and qualified pest control professionals from IPCA Member organisations across the country. Agriculture takes on the issue with incorporated pest management. The term pest" describes more than one cause of problems including illness, unfavorable insects, mites, mollusks, nematodes and weeds. A number of treatment approaches have been used, consisting of chemical methods, such as pesticide applications and poisonous gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or heating up the materials, the use of micro-waves, gamma radiation, modified atmospheres, and anoxic fumigation.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production applies a lot of the same concepts as IPM but limits making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than artificial chemicals. Other claims consist of decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to decrease the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
