Reliance on knowledge, experience, observation and integration of numerous methods makes IPM appropriate for organic farming (leaving out artificial pesticides).</p>
<p>Pesticides need to be registered by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) prior to they can be produced, provided, offered or used in Australia. Rapidly confirm the eligibility of a pesticide item for usage in the LEED v4-certified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program.

<p>If pesticides are necessary, they are chosen and applied in such a way that avoids interrupting other IPM practices. Nearly every kind of pest presents a threat to the homes they populate, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the execution of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or highly specified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outdoor environment.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to monitor for pests and determine them precisely, so that appropriate control choices can be made in combination with action limits.
