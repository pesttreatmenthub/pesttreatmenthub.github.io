<p>By establishing an individualized Integrated Pest Management program for your garden, you can take action-- with the best controls-- when pests appear, and after that rest simple. Consideration of crop plants as active components of multitrophic level interactions is essential to an overall systems approach to pest management. Industrial pest control companies have responsibilities that go far beyond that of managing and getting rid of pests.</p>
<p>Fifty seven of 66 broad spectrum pesticides utilized on rice at the time were banned by presidential decree (Morse & Buhler 1997). In addition to the research and outreach foundation and the 4 elements of management, elements that affect profitable, safe, and cost effective food production at a bigger scale and their ramifications for worldwide food security must also be included in an IPM design.</p>

Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simple meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being practically exclusively about reducing pesticide usage. If all other incorporated pest management techniques are unable to keep an insect pest population below a financial threshold, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid economic loss is justified.</p>

Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term used to describe an organized technique of managing pests using non-chemical pest management approaches and the judicious use of pesticides when pest populations exceed acceptable levels.</p>
