Removal techniques consist of use of animal traps, sticky cards for insects, manual removal of insects from plants (e.g., hand selecting or spraying with a hose), removing infected or infected materials (e.g., pruning branches or removing infected litter).</p>
<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical means to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically damaging levels.
