<p>There are numerous agricultural practices that make the environment less beneficial to insect pests. IPM extended the concept of integrated control to all classes of pests and was broadened to consist of all strategies. This chapter discusses various approaches to maintain pest insects at bearable levels or in other words incorporated pest management (IPM). Keep kids and animals far from areas where pesticides have actually been applied.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family insect pests. Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simple definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost exclusively about lowering pesticide usage.
