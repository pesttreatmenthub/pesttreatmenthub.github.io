<p>Biological control has actually been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address invasive pest issues, classical biological control technique is usually utilized where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control technique that has been effectively utilized against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>It is also obvious from numerous discussions with growers and pest control experts in California that resistance management seen as rotating pesticides amongst different mode of action groups is commonly perceived as IPM, although resistance management is only a part of IPM. Pest control is the regulation or management of a types specified as a pest, a member of the animal kingdom that affects adversely on human activities.</p>
