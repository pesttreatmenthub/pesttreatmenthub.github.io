<p>For instance, diesel-powered tractors are run for vacuuming western stained bug in strawberry 2-3 times or more every week while a pesticide application usually requires using tractor as soon as every 7-14 d. To control particular pests, multiple applications of natural pesticides may be needed with associated threats and costs, while similar pest populations could be managed by less chemical pesticide applications.</p>
