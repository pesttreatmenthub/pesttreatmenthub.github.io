<p>By developing an individualized Integrated Pest Management program for your garden, you can act-- with the right controls-- when pests appear, and after that rest simple.

<p>You just have to invest an hour on the internet to be overwhelmed by worldwide issues: the vicious cycle that develops from the use of large amounts of synthetic fertilizer, which increases reliance on pesticides, which in turn triggers resistance and damage of the environment and human health - while in fifty years' time the world's stocks of the most essential component of synthetic fertilizer, phosphate, will virtually have run out.</p>
