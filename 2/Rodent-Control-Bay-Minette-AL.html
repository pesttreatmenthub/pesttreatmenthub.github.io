<p>For instance, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making procedure that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to determine, manage, and decrease danger from pests and pest management tools and methods in a way that lessens total financial, health, and ecological threats.</p>
<p>In referral to the principle of incorporating the use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later on widened to accept coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have greater levels of resistance.</p>
