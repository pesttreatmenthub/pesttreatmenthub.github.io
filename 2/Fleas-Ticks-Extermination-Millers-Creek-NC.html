A pest control worker might need to eliminate a range or get rid of of animals or bugs to include vermins, roaches, termites, ants, rats, bats, or other wildlife.</p>
<p>IPM is used in agriculture, gardening, forestry, human habitations, preventive conservation and general pest control, including structural pest management, turf pest management and ornamental pest management.
