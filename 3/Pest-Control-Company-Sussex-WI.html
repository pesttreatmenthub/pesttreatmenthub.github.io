<p>There are numerous agricultural practices that make the environment less favorable to insect pests. IPM extended the idea of integrated control to all classes of pests and was broadened to consist of all tactics. This chapter talks about different approaches to maintain pest insects at bearable levels or in other words integrated pest management (IPM). Keep animals and kids far from areas where pesticides have been applied.</p>
<p>Termites consume furniture, documents, books, and even files kept in safes and lockers, therefore triggering gigantic damage within just a couple of months. This stops the pest gaining resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or used to the crops. Exterminators go to customer houses and services to examine for insects or rodents. Classical biological control includes introducing natural enemies from a pest's native range into a new area where native natural opponents do not supply control.</p>
<p>Effective, less risky pest controls are selected first, consisting of highly targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to disrupt pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Examination is typically among the most essential actions in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the procedure of evaluating an IPM program and the results it has produced.</p>
