<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Study Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making procedure that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to determine, handle, and decrease threat from pests and pest management tools and methods in such a way that minimizes general economic, health, and ecological dangers.</p>
<p>Early detection in many cases can help resolve the pest circumstance by low-priced spot treatment or removal of pests or infected or plagued plant product. Unique strategies such as silencing of pest gene or RNA disturbance (RNAi) and endosymbionts hosted by insect pests might be used as prospective new tools for future management of insect pests.</p>
<p>Natural enemies such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be extremely effective in triggering significant decreases in pest populations in certain circumstances (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially available natural enemies or conserving natural opponent populations by supplying sanctuaries or avoiding practices that harm them are some of the typical practices to control endemic pests.</p>
