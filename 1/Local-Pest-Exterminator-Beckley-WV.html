<p>Management of trap and nursery crops and surrounding environment is also consisted of to divert insect attack far from the crop. Managing pests can be performed in many ways but an efficient way is to clear out the bugs frequently.

<p>On the other hand, organic food production uses much of the same principles as IPM however restricts making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of synthetic chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to reduce the need for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
