<p>By developing an individualized Integrated Pest Management program for your garden, you can act-- with the right controls-- when pests appear, and after that rest simple. Consideration of crop plants as active parts of multitrophic level interactions is important to an overall systems approach to pest management.

Sampling may entail examining plants and tape-recording the variety of pests or amount of damage observed, or traps may be used to catch the pest species to estimate pest abundance.</p>
<p>You just have to invest an hour on the internet to be overwhelmed by worldwide issues: the vicious cycle that develops from the use of large amounts of synthetic fertilizer, which increases reliance on pesticides, which in turn triggers resistance and damage of the environment and human health - while in fifty years' time the world's stocks of the most essential component of synthetic fertilizer, phosphate, will virtually have run out.</p>
