<p>Preventing specimens from being assaulted and harmed by pests is a major obstacle of collection management. Some need long-lasting contracts that cost $400 or more even though for most pests, a single treatment done well should be sufficient. Once the committee understands the kinds of pests that might go into the building and perhaps damage collection materials, the next step is to set up an IPPM program to resolve the determined requirements.</p>
