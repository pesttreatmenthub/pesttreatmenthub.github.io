Nests and hives: When you can see hives and nests around your house, it implies that there are a great deal of pests doing their dirty work.

<p>Natural enemies such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be really reliable in causing considerable reductions in pest populations in certain situations (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially readily available natural opponents or conserving natural opponent populations by offering havens or avoiding practices that harm them are some of the typical practices to control endemic pests.</p>
