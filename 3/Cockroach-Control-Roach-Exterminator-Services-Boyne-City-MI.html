<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical means to prevent and control pest populations from reaching financially damaging levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest reliable dosage when other methods of pest control have stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that concentrates on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques such as biological control, environment manipulation, adjustment of cultural practices, and use of resistant ranges.</p>
<p>Natural enemies such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be very reliable in causing substantial decreases in pest populations in certain situations (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially available natural enemies or conserving natural opponent populations by offering havens or avoiding practices that damage them are some of the typical practices to control endemic pests.</p>
