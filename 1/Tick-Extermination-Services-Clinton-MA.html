<p>Biological control has been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control method is generally used where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ).
