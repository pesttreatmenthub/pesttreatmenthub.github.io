Reliable pest management depends on the accurate recognition of the pest. Keep a planting-free zone of about 12 inches around structures to dissuade insects from going into. Because they escape regular control by natural managing agents, frequently organisms rise to pest status.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and prevent pest perseverance consist of intercropping (several crops in the same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
