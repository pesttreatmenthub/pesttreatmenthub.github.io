<p>By establishing an individualized Integrated Pest Management program for your garden, you can take action-- with the best controls-- when pests appear, and after that rest simple. Consideration of crop plants as active components of multitrophic level interactions is essential to an overall systems approach to pest management. Industrial pest control companies have responsibilities that go far beyond that of managing and getting rid of pests.</p>
<p>Fifty seven of 66 broad spectrum pesticides utilized on rice at the time were banned by presidential decree (Morse & Buhler 1997). In addition to the research and outreach foundation and the 4 elements of management, elements that affect profitable, safe, and cost effective food production at a bigger scale and their ramifications for worldwide food security must also be included in an IPM design.</p>
