Besides regular external spraying, whenever there was thought to be a threat of a pest problem establishing, there was no documented or regular pest control program at MTSL at the time of the initial audit.</p>
<p>There are numerous agricultural practices that make the environment less beneficial to insect pests. IPM extended the concept of integrated control to all classes of pests and was broadened to consist of all strategies. This chapter discusses various approaches to maintain pest insects at bearable levels or in other words incorporated pest management (IPM). Keep kids and animals far from areas where pesticides have actually been applied.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family insect pests. Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simple definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost exclusively about lowering pesticide usage. If all other integrated pest management tactics are not able to keep an insect pest population below a financial limit, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid economic loss is justified.</p>
