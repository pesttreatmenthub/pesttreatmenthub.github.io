IPM is the choice and use of pest control actions that will guarantee favourable financial condition, social and ecological repercussions 13 and is applicable to many agricultural, public health and amenity pest management situations.</p>
<p>Early detection in a lot of cases can help attend to the pest situation by affordable spot treatment or removal of pests or plagued or contaminated plant material.
