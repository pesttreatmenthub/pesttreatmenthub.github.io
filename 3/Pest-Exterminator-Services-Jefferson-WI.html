Here, insecticides will just be used when they are financially feasible and it is apparent that natural enemies will not control the pests. Crop rotation: Monocultures supply potential cotton pests with abundant food sources, causing their populations to increase quickly.</p>
<p>When pest issues are avoided, pests are not present to do damage, so no control measures are needed.
