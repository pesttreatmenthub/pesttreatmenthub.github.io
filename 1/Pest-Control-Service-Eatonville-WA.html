<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been recommended as an IPM strategy by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not take off because growers were not ready for such an intercropping arrangement. If your facility currently utilizes an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be shocked to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to move toward least-impact products and services.</p>
<p>Some likewise acknowledged that if regionally coordinated IPM might take place, even yearly management of a consistent pest could be made more efficient (Faust and Chandler, 1998).
