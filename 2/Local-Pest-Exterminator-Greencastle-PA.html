If your facility currently uses an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you won't be shocked to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to move toward least-impact services and products.</p>
<p>Pest control has actually been designated a necessary service throughout the present pandemic so, deal with your pest control company to continue servicing your business. Reliable pest management depends upon the accurate recognition of the pest. Keep a planting-free zone of about 12 inches around buildings to prevent insects from going into.
