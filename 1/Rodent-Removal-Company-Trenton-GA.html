<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to avoid and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical techniques such as cultural practices, usage of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM considers the ecosystem as a whole and takes into consideration a balanced mix of the previously mentioned control approaches to produce the most reliable and least destructive strategy.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and discourage pest perseverance include intercropping (numerous crops in the very same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests far from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have actually emerged and died off for the season.</p>
