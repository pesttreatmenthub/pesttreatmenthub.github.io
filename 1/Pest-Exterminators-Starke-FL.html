<p>If, after following organized and preventive management practices (# 1, 2, 3, and 4), pests are above limit levels and beneficials populations are low, release beneficials or apply selected biopesticides with low ecological effect. Professional exterminators use different types of pesticides and baits to eliminate and remove pests.
