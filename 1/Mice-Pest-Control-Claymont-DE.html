<p>Biological control has actually been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to intrusive pest problems, classical biological control method is generally utilized where natural enemies from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and launched in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has actually been efficiently utilized against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
