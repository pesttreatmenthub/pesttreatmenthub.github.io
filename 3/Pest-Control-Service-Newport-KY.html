<p>The brand-new ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) technology where double-stranded RNA is applied to silence particular genes in the target insect is thought about as biopesticide application (Gordon and Waterhouse 2007 ). Particular biostimulants based on minerals, microbes, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart induced systemic resistance to pests, diseases, and abiotic stressors, but are applied as amendments without any claims for pest or illness control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ). These new products or innovations can fall into several abovementioned classifications of pest management.</p>
