<p>Socio-psychological factors consisting of moral and reasonable factors to consider were discovered to the drivers in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that an absence of certified IPM specialists and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM application in developed nations.</p>
<p>Fifty 7 of 66 broad spectrum pesticides used on rice at the time were banned by presidential decree (Morse & Buhler 1997). In addition to the research and outreach foundation and the four elements of management, factors that affect successful, safe, and economical food production at a bigger scale and their implications for worldwide food security must likewise be consisted of in an IPM design.</p>
<p>The many differing dangers from pests make it a good idea for cultural heritage companies to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and buildings. In these nations, routine usage of pesticides is limited to high value (cash) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mostly centered on cotton, rice, sugarcane, and soybean.</p>
