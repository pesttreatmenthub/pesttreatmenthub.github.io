<p>The brand-new ribonucleic acid disturbance (RNAi) technology where double-stranded RNA is applied to silence particular genes in the target bug is thought about as biopesticide application (Gordon and Waterhouse 2007 ). Particular biostimulants based upon minerals, microbes, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart induced systemic resistance to pests, diseases, and abiotic stress factors, but are applied as changes without any claims for pest or disease control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ). These brand-new items or technologies can fall under one or more abovementioned categories of pest management.</p>
