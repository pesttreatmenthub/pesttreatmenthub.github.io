In Asia, different stages of IPM have actually been effectively embraced in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), USA (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, veggies), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (veggies, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
