<p>Socio-psychological aspects including moral and reasonable factors to consider were found to the chauffeurs in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of veggie growers in Sri Lanka revealed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A survey conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that an absence of certified IPM professionals and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM execution in industrialized countries.</p>
<p>Typical pest like bed bugs, cockroaches, termites, mosquito etc can be so excruciating at times that the only option left is to work with a regional pest control company to remove pests.
