<p>Similar to us, pests need food, shelter, and water to endure, and if they can't discover these in your home, it's likely they'll go elsewhere. If they can not enter it, pests can not survive without food and will not infest a structure. Another approach includes utilizing baits that either destroy the pests or avoid them from recreating.
