<p>The professional user should keep using pesticides and other forms of intervention to levels that are essential, e.g. by lowered dosages, reduced application frequency or partial applications, thinking about that the level of danger in plants is acceptable and they do not increase the risk for development of resistance in populations of hazardous organisms.</p>
