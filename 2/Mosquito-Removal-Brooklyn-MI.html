<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making procedure that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to recognize, handle, and lower danger from pests and pest management tools and strategies in a way that reduces general economic, health, and environmental risks.</p>
<p>IPM techniques include both chemical and nonchemical methods to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the smallest effective dosage when other approaches of pest control have stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that concentrates on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a mix of methods such as biological control, habitat adjustment, modification of cultural practices, and usage of resistant ranges.</p>
<p>With over 20 different reports of all farm activities, from planting, protecting, keeping to harvesting, Agrivi allows farmers to track invested amounts of organic pesticides and fertilizers per fields and crops, their finances and farm performance and to print it out. If you have a termite problem at home, don't waste too much time prior to you require termite pest control as the damages triggered by these insects are very costly to fix.</p>

Government regulations restrict the time and amount of particular chemical pesticides and help reduce the involved risks.</p>
