The chemical controls are used just after routine monitoring suggests that a pest population had reached a financial threshold level. Many private product growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to specify what IPM indicates for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are available in restricted areas.</p>
