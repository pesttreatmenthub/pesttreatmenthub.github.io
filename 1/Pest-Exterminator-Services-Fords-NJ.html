<p>Tighter guidelines for food security, occupational health and safety, and the environment mean in-house pest control isn't a choice for lots of food services these days. Farmers are confronted with myriad of production challenges where the most typical problems are pests, that include insects, illness, and weeds.

Current missions for efficient, safe, and long lasting pest management programs have been targeted mainly toward development of brand-new and much better items with which to change standard harmful pesticides.</p>
