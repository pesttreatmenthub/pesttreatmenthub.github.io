<p>This combination of IGRs can be reliable in avoiding re-infestation of pests such as cockroaches.

Applicators carry out more complex tasks, have the ability to use a larger range of pesticides, and might focus on a particular location of pest control.</p>
<p>A specific pest can be managed by specific choices, but they may not all be readily available in a specific location, for a specific crop, or within the available financial ways. IPM involves using the very best combination of cultural, biological and chemical measures for particular scenarios, including plant biotechnology as proper.
