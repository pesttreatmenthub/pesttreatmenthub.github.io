<p>Socio-psychological aspects consisting of moral and reasonable considerations were discovered to the drivers in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of veggie growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness event and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise showed that an absence of qualified IPM specialists and extension teachers was an obstacle for IPM execution in industrialized nations.</p>
<p>For instance, rodents threaten grain snails, yields and birds damage strawberries, potato beetles attack potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplants.

Although, initially developed for agricultural pest management, IPM programmes are now established to encompass diseases, weeds, and other pests that may interfere with the management goals of websites such as commercial and residential structures, lawn and grass areas, and house and community gardens.</p>
