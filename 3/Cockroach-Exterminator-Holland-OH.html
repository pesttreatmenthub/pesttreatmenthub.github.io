<h3>Things You Should Know When Hiring a Pest Control Company Holland OH</h3>
<p>The scientific basis of "Integrated Pest Control" evolved over a duration of about ten years, primarily amongst scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside campuses. Crops are typically monocultures, including a single crop species, which develops a homogenous environment often lacking essential requirements of natural enemies, therefore preferring pest types.</p>
<p>Kept item pests are most likely to be in a food active ingredient on shipment to a processing factory or a processed foodstuff when stored for a long time. Using pesticides to crops, animals, structures or landscapes on a regular basis, regardless of requirement, is not IPM. The reliance on pesticides as a sole method of control has led to the development of insect resistance and unfavorable effects on human health, natural enemies, and the environment.</p>
