<h3>Bug And Pest Control Mount Pleasant Texas</h2>
<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve invasive pest concerns, classical biological control approach is generally used where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has actually been successfully used versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
