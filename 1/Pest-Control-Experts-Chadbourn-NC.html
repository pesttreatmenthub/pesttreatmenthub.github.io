<p>In referral to the idea of integrating the use of biological and other controls in complementary ways, the term was later on widened to embrace coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have higher levels of resistance.</p>
