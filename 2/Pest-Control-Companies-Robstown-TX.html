<p>Pesticides are either unscheduled or they fall under schedules 5, 6 or 7. Each schedule has a warning, which appears in big contrasting lettering on the label.

Our AMC services include minimum of 3 to 4 treatments in the whole year to prevent brand-new pests to nest back in your property.</p>
<p>Insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and other pest control and lawn care items are most reliable when they are used effectively.
