SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood boring insects which, in a collection environment, might trigger severe damage to structures, office furniture, specimens and artifacts. Applicators perform more complex tasks, have the ability to use a wider series of pesticides, and might specialize in a specific location of pest control.</p>
<p>There are things you can do right away before your pest control expert gets here on the scene.
