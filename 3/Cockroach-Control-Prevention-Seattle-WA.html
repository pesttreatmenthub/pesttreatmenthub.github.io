<p>The decision of the proper reason for pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in manipulating the environment to the crop's advantage and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to a lot of insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural opponents than materials that are narrow-spectrum or selective for particular insect species or life phases.</p>
<p>The best way to control pests is to make your house unappealing to them. But household pests can likewise be a threat to your household. When searching for a place to infest, pests choose to hide in a location that offers food and a safe breeding ground. Biological control is a lot easier to execute in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (several crops).</p>
<p>At the same time, it is also based on semiochemicals especially allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are pushed back or hindered far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are simultaneously attracted (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or removed 35 (Figure 5 ). The majority of pesticide issues are triggered by a little number of the pesticides offered today.</p>
