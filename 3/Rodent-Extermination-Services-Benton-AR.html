<p>The second employee is an applicator, who utilizes a large range of pesticides and might concentrate on a particular area of pest control. Predators eliminate their prey that damages crops, for example, ladybugs reduce aphid numbers. Sometimes release of natural enemies even prior to the pest exists is possible, or required for optimal effectiveness.

<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family insect pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a a lot more simplified definition of IPM - they see IPM as being nearly specifically about decreasing pesticide usage. If all other integrated pest management methods are not able to keep an insect pest population listed below an economic threshold, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid economic loss is justified.</p>
<p>Efficient, less risky pest controls are picked initially, including highly targeted chemicals, such as scents to interfere with pest breeding, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Examination is frequently one of the most crucial actions in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the process of examining an IPM program and the results it has actually generated.</p>
