<p>Just then can we reduce making use of artificial fertilizers, minimize reliance on pesticides and boost performance. Here, insecticides will just be used when they are economically possible and it is apparent that natural enemies will not control the pests.

<p>Rather, call HiCare and have our professionals inspect your houses for white ants and termites.

Boron, a recognized pesticide can be impregnated into the paper fibers of cellulose insulation at particular levels to attain a mechanical kill element for self-grooming insects such as ants, cockroaches, termites, and more.
