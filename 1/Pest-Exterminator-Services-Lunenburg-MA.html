<p>There are many agricultural practices that make the environment less beneficial to insect pests. IPM extended the idea of integrated control to all classes of pests and was broadened to consist of all techniques. This chapter goes over different approaches to maintain pest insects at bearable levels or simply put incorporated pest management (IPM). Keep children and animals far from areas where pesticides have been applied.</p>
<p>A thorough knowledge of general IPM principles and various management options for all possible pest problems is essential as some are preventive and others are alleviative. We normally advise pest control chemicals that finish the job utilizing the least amount of item. Broad spectrum pesticides (as a last hope). These prevention and control strategies include biological, mechanical, cultural, physical, genetic, chemical, and regulatory methods.</p>
<p>The term "incorporated" was therefore associated with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be used only after routine tracking indicated that a pest population had actually reached a level (the economic threshold) that needed treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which financial losses would exceed the expense of the control steps.</p>
